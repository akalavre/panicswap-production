# PanicSwap Demo Guide - Test with ANY Real Token!

## How to Test PanicSwap with Real Tokens

PanicSwap's demo mode now allows you to test our protection system with **any real Solana token**. This means you can:

1. Copy a token mint address from your favorite trading platform
2. Paste it into our demo
3. See real-time price data and protection features in action

## Where to Find Token Addresses

### From Trading Platforms:
- **pump.fun**: Copy the token address from any token page
- **Raydium**: Get the mint address from the token info section
- **Jupiter**: Copy from the token details
- **DexScreener**: Use the contract address shown on any token page
- **Birdeye**: Copy the token mint from the token overview

### How It Works:

1. **Enter Token Address**: Paste any valid Solana token mint address
2. **Automatic Data Fetch**: Our backend will:
   - Fetch token metadata from the blockchain
   - Get current price and liquidity data
   - Identify which DEX the token trades on (Raydium, pump.fun, etc.)
   - Analyze risk factors if it's a pump.fun token

3. **Demo Features**: You'll get:
   - 1,000,000 demo tokens to test with
   - Real-time price monitoring
   - Protection alerts based on actual market conditions
   - Simulated protection actions (no real trades executed)

## Example Tokens to Try:

While you can use ANY token, here are some popular ones:

### Established Tokens:
- **SOL**: `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`
- **USDC**: `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`

### Find New Tokens:
1. Go to pump.fun and find any trending token
2. Copy its mint address
3. Paste into PanicSwap demo
4. Watch real-time protection in action!

## What Data We Fetch:

When you add a token, we automatically retrieve:
- Token name and symbol
- Current price and 24h change
- Liquidity and trading volume
- Platform (Raydium, pump.fun, etc.)
- Risk analysis for pump.fun tokens

## Benefits:

- **Test with tokens you're actually interested in**
- **See how PanicSwap would protect your real investments**
- **Understand our protection thresholds and alerts**
- **No wallet connection required for demo**

## Important Notes:

- Demo mode uses simulated balances (not your real tokens)
- Protection actions are simulated (no real trades)
- Price data and alerts are real and live
- Token data is cached for future use
