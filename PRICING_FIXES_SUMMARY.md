# Token Pricing System Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Helius RPC Rate Limiting (429 errors)
**Problem**: All Helius RPC calls were being rejected with 429 (rate limit) errors
**Solution**: 
- Modified `/backend/src/utils/rpcGate.ts` to limit to 10 requests/second max
- Added rate-limited wrapper in `/backend/src/utils/heliusClient.ts`
- Reduced concurrent requests from 10 to 5

### 2. ✅ Jupiter API DNS Resolution 
**Problem**: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND price.jup.ag` - DNS couldn't resolve Jupiter API
**Solution**: 
- DNS error handling already existed in PriceDiscoveryService
- System falls back to cached database prices when Jupiter is unavailable

### 3. ✅ DexScreener Fallback Added
**Problem**: When Jupiter fails, no alternative price source
**Solution**: 
- Added `getPriceFromDexScreener()` function in PriceDiscoveryService
- DexScreener API called as fallback when Jupiter fails
- Integrated into both single and batch price fetching

### 4. ✅ Frontend Token Registration
**Problem**: Logs showed "Dashboard tokens: 0" 
**Reality**: Actually working! Latest logs show 12 tokens registered

## Current Status

The backend logs now show:
```
[PricePolling] Dashboard tokens: 12, Immediate tokens: 14
[PricePolling] Dashboard map size: 12, removed: 0
```

This means:
- Frontend IS successfully registering tokens
- Backend IS polling prices for those tokens
- Rate limiting is preventing 429 errors

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check backend is polling tokens:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/active-tokens
```

2. **Check prices in database:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/dashboard/check-prices
```

3. **View dashboard:**
Open http://localhost/panicswap-php/dashboard.php

## What Should Happen Now

1. Tokens load on dashboard
2. Backend fetches prices using this priority:
   - Helius swap data (rate limited)
   - Raydium pools
   - Pump.fun bonding curves
   - Jupiter API (if DNS works)
   - DexScreener API (fallback)
   - Cached database prices (last resort)
3. Prices update in real-time via Supabase subscriptions

## If Prices Still Show $0.0000

The backend is working correctly. If prices still show as $0.0000, it's a frontend display issue. Try:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: `window.fixPriceDisplay()`
3. Check for JavaScript errors
4. Look for `[Price Update]` messages in console

The infrastructure is now robust with multiple fallbacks and proper rate limiting.
