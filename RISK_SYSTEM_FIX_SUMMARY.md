# Risk System Fix Summary

## Problem
Tokens were showing "Safe" as the default risk level when no risk data was available, which could mislead users into thinking a token was analyzed and deemed safe.

## Root Causes
1. Multiple places in the code defaulted to "Safe" when risk data was missing
2. Backend returned "MINIMAL" which mapped to "Safe" in frontend
3. Risk normalization functions defaulted to "Safe" for unknown values
4. RiskStore initialized with "Safe" defaults instead of null
5. Badge rendering showed "Safe" instead of loading/analyzing state

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend JavaScript Files

#### `/assets/js/risk-levels.js`
- Modified `normalizeLegacyRiskLevel()` to return `null` instead of defaulting to `SAFE`
- Modified `getRiskBadgeConfig()` to handle null risk levels properly

#### `/assets/js/risk-store.js`
- Changed initialization to use `null` instead of 'Safe' defaults
- Updated validation to allow null values for incomplete data
- Modified `_computeFinalRisk()` to keep null when no sources exist

#### `/assets/js/components/token-list-badges.js`
- Updated to handle null risk levels and not default to Safe
- Modified `normalizeRiskLevel()` to return null for unknown values
- Changed placeholder badges to show loading state

#### `/assets/js/atomic-badge-renderer.js`
- Updated `generateBadgeHTML()` to show "Analyzing" state for incomplete data
- Added proper null checking before rendering risk badges

#### `/assets/js/dashboard/real-time-risk.js`
- Fixed `renderRiskBadge()` to show "Analyzing" when no risk level exists
- Removed automatic defaulting to "Safe" for low risk scores

#### `/assets/js/monitoring-data-fetcher.js`
- Changed default from "Low" to `null` when no badge state exists
- Added check to only update RiskStore when valid risk data is available

#### `/assets/js/dashboard/ml-risk-display.js`
- Changed default from "Safe" to `null` in `updateTokenMLRisk()`

### 2. Backend (TypeScript)

#### `/backend/src/config/riskBuckets.ts`
- Uses "MINIMAL" (0-20) which maps to "safe" action
- This is correct for actual low-risk tokens

### 3. PHP API

#### `/api/monitoring-status.php`
- Returns `null` for badge state when no specific state is detected
- Does not default to any risk level

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **New tokens with no data**: Show "Analyzing" with spinning icon
2. **Tokens being processed**: Maintain "Analyzing" state until data arrives
3. **Tokens with errors**: Continue showing "Analyzing" or appropriate error state
4. **Only show "Safe"**: When risk score is actually calculated and is < 20

## Testing
To verify the fixes:
1. Add a new token to the dashboard
2. It should show "Analyzing" initially, not "Safe"
3. Once risk data is calculated, it should show the appropriate risk level
4. Only tokens with risk scores < 20 should show "Safe"

## Key Principle
**Never assume a token is safe by default. Always require positive confirmation through actual risk analysis before showing "Safe" status.**
