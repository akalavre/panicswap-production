# Badge Stability Fix Summary

## Problem
The risk badge was flickering/changing states multiple times after initial render due to:
1. Multiple API responses arriving at different times
2. Incremental data updates causing badge recalculation
3. No delay mechanism to wait for complete data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes (`api/monitoring-status.php`)
- Added `hasCompleteData` flag to indicate when all critical data is available
- Added `dataAge` field to track how long since token was added
- Enhanced badge state calculation to be more deterministic

### 2. Frontend Changes (`assets/js/unified-badge-service.js`)
- Added initial load delay (1.5s) to wait for complete data before showing badge
- Added minimum badge display time (2s) to prevent rapid state changes
- Track data completeness to decide when to render badge
- Allow immediate escalation only for critical states (SELL_NOW, SELL)

### 3. Data Service Changes (`assets/js/unified-token-data-service.js`)
- Pass through all badge-related fields from API
- Include data completeness indicators
- Properly normalize velocity data for badge calculations

## Key Features

1. **Initial Load Delay**: Badge waits up to 1.5 seconds for complete data before first render
2. **Minimum Display Time**: Each badge state must be displayed for at least 2 seconds (except critical alerts)
3. **Data Completeness Check**: Backend signals when it has enough data for stable badge calculation
4. **Priority-based Updates**: Higher severity badges can override lower ones immediately

## Testing
Use `test-badge-stability.html` to verify the fix:
1. Enter a token mint and wallet address
2. Click "Start Badge Test"
3. Observe that badge doesn't flicker between states
4. Check the badge history and API logs for details

## Result
The badge now shows a stable state based on complete data, eliminating the flickering issue while still allowing immediate escalation for critical sell signals.
