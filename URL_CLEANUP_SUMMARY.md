## Remaining Considerations

### API Calls in JavaScript
Many JavaScript files use relative API paths without leading slashes:
- `fetch('api/...')` instead of `fetch('/api/...')`

This works fine in most cases, but for absolute consistency and to avoid issues with subdirectory installations, you may want to consider updating these to use absolute paths.

### Files with relative API calls:
- assets/js/atomic-badge-renderer.js
- assets/js/auto-sell.js
- assets/js/dashboard/add-test-token.js
- assets/js/dashboard/token-data-fetcher.js
- assets/js/payment.js
- assets/js/protection-toggle.js
- assets/js/protectionApi.js
- assets/js/subscription-status.js
- assets/js/wallet-adapter.js
- assets/js/wallet-button-ui.js
- assets/js/wallet-state.js

### .htaccess Configuration
The .htaccess file is properly configured to:
- Remove .php extensions from URLs
- Handle clean URL routing
- Properly route API, assets, backend, and components directories
- Add security headers

## Deployment Notes

For Digital Ocean App Platform deployment:
1. The app.yaml configuration properly routes `/api` to the backend service
2. All internal navigation links now use clean URLs without .php extensions
3. The .htaccess file handles URL rewriting for Apache servers
4. For nginx servers, you'll need equivalent rewrite rules in nginx.conf

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, test these URLs:
- [ ] / (homepage)
- [ ] /dashboard
- [ ] /subscription
- [ ] /how-it-works
- [ ] API endpoints (/api/*)
- [ ] Navigation between pages
- [ ] Subscription upgrade flow
- [ ] Payment redirect flow
