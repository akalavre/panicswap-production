# RugCheck Service Improvements

## Summary
Based on the feedback received, we've implemented significant improvements to the RugCheck polling service to address rate limiting, performance, and scalability concerns.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Rate Limit Protection ✅
- Created `rateLimitWrapper.ts` with exponential backoff using p-retry
- All Helius API calls now wrapped with retry logic
- Handles 429 status codes and -32005 error codes gracefully
- Configurable retry attempts and timeout limits

### 2. Batch Processing ✅
- Created `RugCheckPollingServiceV2.ts` with batch processing
- Processes 20 tokens every 30 seconds (configurable)
- Reduces API calls from 1/second to batches
- Queue-based processing with automatic retry on failures

### 3. Improved API Performance ✅
- Replaced `getTokenAccounts` with `getTokenAccountsByMint`
- Better performance and more accurate results
- Reduced response payload size

### 4. Configuration Management ✅
- Created `rugcheckConfig.ts` for centralized configuration
- Risk score weights now configurable
- Polling intervals configurable via environment variables
- Known bundler program IDs list maintained

### 5. Database Optimization ✅
- Implemented bulk updates to Supabase
- Buffers updates in memory and flushes every 5 seconds
- Stays well under Supabase's 50 rps limit
- Uses upsert for efficient updates

### 6. Enhanced Caching ✅
- Implemented `SimpleCache` with TTL for each data type:
  - Holder counts: 30 seconds (pump.fun already rounds)
  - Creator balance: 60 seconds
  - LP locked: 120 seconds
  - Bundler counts: 60 seconds

### 7. Type Safety Improvements ✅
- Added null coalescing (?? 0) for numeric comparisons
- Better error handling for invalid mint addresses
- Proper authority validation with burn address checks

### 8. Debug Endpoint ✅
- Added `/api/v1/debug/rugcheck/:mint` endpoint
- Returns raw on-chain metrics for debugging
- Shows database state, real-time data, and configuration

## Environment Variables

```env
# RugCheck Configuration
RUGCHECK_USE_BATCH=true           # Enable batch processing (V2)
RUGCHECK_BATCH_SIZE=20            # Tokens per batch
RUGCHECK_BATCH_DELAY=30000        # Delay between batches (ms)
RUGCHECK_POLL_INTERVAL=1000       # Poll interval (ms)
RUGCHECK_MAX_CONCURRENT=5         # Max concurrent requests

# Helius Configuration
HELIUS_API_KEY=your-api-key       # Fallback if not in RPC URL
```

## Usage

### Enable Batch Processing
Set `RUGCHECK_USE_BATCH=true` to use the new V2 service with all improvements.

### Debug Token Data
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/debug/rugcheck/[MINT_ADDRESS]
```

### Monitor Performance
The service logs batch processing stats and queue sizes for monitoring.

## Migration Notes

1. The original service remains available for backward compatibility
2. V2 service is opt-in via environment variable
3. Both services write to the same database tables
4. Frontend remains unchanged - improvements are backend only

## Next Steps

1. Monitor rate limit metrics in production
2. Adjust batch sizes based on actual usage
3. Consider implementing WebSocket updates for critical tokens
4. Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
