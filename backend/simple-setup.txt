SIMPLE WEBHOOK SETUP
===================

Step 1: Open 3 terminals in WSL

Step 2: In Terminal 1, start backend:
npm run dev

Step 3: In Terminal 2, start ngrok:
ngrok http 3001

Step 4: Copy the HTTPS URL from ngrok output
(It looks like: https://abc123def.ngrok-free.app)

Step 5: In Terminal 3, register webhook:
WEBHOOK_URL=https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook/helius npx ts-node register-webhooks.ts

Replace YOUR-NGROK-URL with the actual URL from step 4.

That's all! Your webhook is ready to receive price updates.
