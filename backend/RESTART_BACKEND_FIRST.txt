IMPORTANT: Backend Restart Required!
===================================

The monitoring routes have been added to the backend code, but the backend
needs to be restarted to load them.

Steps to fix:
1. Stop the backend (press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal)
2. Start it again: npm run dev
3. Run fix-monitoring.bat again

OR use the automated script:
   restart-and-fix.bat

This will:
- Guide you to restart the backend
- Automatically run the fix
- Set up all monitoring data

The 404 error on /api/monitoring/force-update is expected until the backend
is restarted with the new code.
