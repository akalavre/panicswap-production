# Token Pricing System Analysis Request

## Context
We have a token dashboard (PanicSwap) that displays cryptocurrency token prices in real-time. The system has three main components:
1. **Frontend** (PHP/JavaScript) - Displays token list with prices
2. **Backend** (Node.js/Express) - Polls token prices from various APIs
3. **Database** (Supabase) - Stores token data and prices

## Current Issue
Token prices show as $0.0000 on the dashboard despite the backend successfully fetching and storing prices in the database.

## System Architecture

### Data Flow:
1. User loads dashboard.php
2. Frontend fetches user's tokens from Supabase
3. Frontend registers these tokens with backend via POST /api/dashboard/register-tokens
4. Backend polls prices every second for registered tokens
5. Backend writes prices to Supabase tables (token_prices and token_price_history)
6. Frontend should receive real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
7. Frontend displays updated prices in the token list

### Key Files:
- **Frontend**: `/components/token-list-v3.php` - Main token list component
- **Frontend**: `/assets/js/supabase-token-fetcher.js` - Fetches token data
- **Backend**: `/backend/src/services/PricePollingService.ts` - Polls prices
- **Backend**: `/backend/src/services/PriceDiscoveryService.ts` - Fetches from APIs
- **Backend**: `/backend/src/routes/dashboardTokensRoutes.ts` - Registration endpoint

### Database Tables:
- `wallet_tokens` - User's token holdings
- `token_metadata` - Token symbols, names, logos
- `token_prices` - Current prices
- `token_price_history` - Historical prices
- `rugcheck_reports` - Risk analysis data

## What We Know Works:
1. ✅ Backend successfully polls prices (logs show "Polling prices for 12 tokens")
2. ✅ Prices are stored in database (verified via /api/dashboard/check-prices)
3. ✅ Frontend registers tokens with backend (server logs confirm)
4. ✅ Token data loads correctly (symbols, balances display)

## What's Not Working:
1. ❌ Prices display as $0.0000 instead of actual values
2. ❌ Real-time price updates don't reflect in UI
3. ❌ Initial price loading seems to miss the price data

## Sample Data:
Backend has prices like:
- 3ckPwKXo8gtWCWpskGmCCowU1uoZC3PjQ2yjce5Apump: $0.00000426
- 8NM7yd2EWtGHBYmusCdqQ2h9K333gZ3f8RPEg7G5moon: $0.00000425

But frontend shows all as $0.0000

## Analysis Request:
Please analyze the pricing system to:

1. **Identify the disconnect** between backend prices and frontend display
2. **Review the data flow** from price fetching to UI rendering
3. **Check Supabase real-time subscriptions** - Are price updates being broadcast?
4. **Examine the token data structure** - Is the price field properly mapped?
5. **Investigate timing issues** - Are tokens loaded before prices are available?
6. **Review number formatting** - Are very small prices (0.00000426) being rounded to 0?

## Specific Questions:
1. Why do prices show as $0.0000 when the backend has valid price data?
2. Is the Supabase real-time subscription properly configured and receiving updates?
3. Is there a race condition between token loading and price availability?
4. Are the price fields correctly mapped between backend and frontend data structures?
5. Could the scientific notation prices (4.26103e-06) be causing display issues?

## Desired Outcome:
- Prices should display immediately when tokens are loaded
- Price updates from backend should reflect in real-time without page refresh
- Very small prices should display correctly (e.g., $0.00000426)
- The system should handle both initial load and ongoing updates seamlessly

## Additional Context:
- External APIs (Jupiter, Helius) have rate limiting issues but prices ARE being fetched
- A temporary fix (fix-price-display.js) can manually update prices, proving the data exists
- Debug tools have been created to test each component separately
- The issue persists across different wallets and token sets

Please provide a comprehensive analysis of the pricing system and recommend specific fixes to ensure prices display correctly.
