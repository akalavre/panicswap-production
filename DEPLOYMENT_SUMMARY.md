## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Automated Monitoring Scripts Created:

1. **deployment-monitor.php** - Full 48-hour monitoring
   - Checks API health every 5 minutes
   - Monitors database connectivity
   - Tracks error rates and anomalies
   - Triggers alerts if error threshold exceeded

2. **quick-deploy-check.php** - Immediate verification
   - Instant deployment health check
   - Validates all critical components
   - Provides success/failure summary

3. **rollback.php** - Emergency rollback capability
   - Reverts to previous commit if needed
   - Clears caches and verifies functionality
   - Available via CLI or web interface

### Monitoring Commands:

```bash
# Start full 48-hour monitoring
php deployment-monitor.php

# Quick health check
php quick-deploy-check.php

# Emergency rollback (if needed)
php rollback.php
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Manual)

### Immediate (0-2 hours):
1. Start monitoring: `php deployment-monitor.php`
2. Monitor logs in: `deployment-monitoring.log`
3. Watch for error alerts and user reports

### Short-term (2-24 hours):
1. Check monitoring logs regularly
2. Monitor user feedback channels
3. Watch for performance anomalies
4. Verify all functionality working as expected

### Medium-term (24-48 hours):
1. Continue monitoring for stability
2. Collect performance metrics
3. Document any issues found
4. Prepare final deployment report

## 🔄 Rollback Criteria

**Trigger rollback if any of the following occur:**
- Error rate exceeds 10 errors/hour
- Critical functionality failures
- Database connectivity issues
- User reports of major problems
- Performance degradation > 50%
